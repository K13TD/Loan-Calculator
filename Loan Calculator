# Get the loan amount
principal = float(input("Enter the loan amount: "))

# Get the interest rate
interest_rate = float(input("Enter the interest rate: "))

# Get the loan term in years
loan_term_years = float(input("Enter the loan term (in years): "))

# Calculate the number of months
loan_term_months = loan_term_years * 12

# Calculate the monthly interest rate
monthly_interest_rate = interest_rate / 1200

# Calculate the monthly payment
monthly_payment = principal * monthly_interest_rate / (1 - (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** (-loan_term_months))

# Display the monthly payment
print(f"\nMonthly Payment: ${monthly_payment:.2f}")
